# REACT SUPERHERO SPA | APP ðŸ¦¸ ðŸ¦¹ 

This project made with React.js is a Single Page Application (SPA) searcher of heroes of Dc and Marvel.
It is made with functional components which are recommended by the Facebook Team who developed "React", using hooks, and Context, Router which make the chance to be a Single Page Application, with a login that in the next release of the project will be improved.
Just for the moment the data is not in a backend, it is in a file "data.js" but in the next release of this project I will connect to an API through the backend with Node.js.
I use Bootstrap for the style and some custom Css.
